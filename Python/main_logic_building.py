# Factorial Program using while loop
num = int(input("Enter the number of your choice: "))
iterator = 0 # set to 0 for convience, to make iterations work properly and as expected
factorial = 1 
# We want to start multiplying from 1, because this is how mainly factorial works 
# and you don't want to multiply everything to 0

while iterator != num:
    iterator += 1
    factorial *= iterator
    print(f"{iterator}st iteration = {factorial}") # Just made this for your convenience to foster better understanding

print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}")
