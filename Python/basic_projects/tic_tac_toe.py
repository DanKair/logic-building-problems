# Display the table
# 1. Create the 3x3 grid matrix (1-9 positions)
# 2. every 3 steps, make a line break
# 3. Allow items in the collection type to be replaced (probably strings)

    
# Game Logic Functionality
# 1. Ask 2 user inputs (Probably would make someone make a first step randomly)
# 2. Create winning positions tuple (cause it shouldn't be)
# 3. Play the game while there are no empty position left or until someone win
# 4. Ask user to input the position, and replace it with his corresponidng symbol (X or O)
# 5. user1 or user2 on win_position: print("Congratulationsüéâ! {user} win‚ú®!")

# User input Logic
# 1. After user enters the number, check which range it corresponds
# 2. if number > 3: go to 2nd row, elif number > 6: go to 3rd row and etc

# Validation Logics
# 1. Don't allow user to exceed the range of positions (position_num < 9 and position_num > 0)
# 2. Don't allow users to replace non-empty slot
# 3. Save user moves in some kinda array, if user_move already in moves list: position is already been used!

    [1, 2, 3],

# Fix issues | Needs Imporvement
# 1. Add exception logic to don't allow users to replace their signs (e.g make same move) ‚úî
# 2. Handle less win positions, e.g allow unordered positions ‚úî
# 3. Make one replace logic, which will just replace with whosTurn variable ‚úî
